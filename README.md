# Gradebook

OBJECTIVE:

This project uses Python load and merge a class roster and assignment scores from three different csv files. The data in these files are cleaned, filtered and merged into a single pandas dataframe. Cumulative scores are calculated and letter grades are assigned using point total and weights-based methods.
